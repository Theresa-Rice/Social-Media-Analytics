"No, the driver went way beyond as far as being a creep!!! Definitely report him and they will block him from being your driver again… just keep an eye out if he does show up at your work worst case scenario you can file a restraining order against him. I would also suggest getting gel pepper spray for protection, and learn to stand your ground when you tell someone no. If anybody does that again, just tell them you’re married.. It works for me."
Not an overreaction. Trust your intuition here. You can file a report that the driver&#39;s flirtatious advances crossed a line and if multiple passengers file similar complaints he could get suspended/revoked. 
I dont think it has to do with accelerating the process. Uber drivers arent supposed to hit on you or make you feel like you cant get out of the car period. 
I just mean think of how many victims don&#39;t report such an incident because they&#39;re not sure if they could get someone fired.
Those Waymo cars won&#39;t have this problem. I can&#39;t wait. Stay strong Redditor. I wish this didn&#39;t happen to you.
No they can’t see your address once you’re dropped off it’s not on there 
Report his ass right away and get him booted off the platform. There is a certain group of people that have zero respect for women and think they are just there to play with. Every assault starts with a no so you need to get him out now. Block that number too. If I can be so bold as to say that was really stupid giving him your number. He probably thinks you are easy.
Turn on the recording for safety feature. Drivers get a notification that you may record audio. That should help both prove creepiness in the future and deter some of that behavior.
Report and 1star. Men should learn and know when to take hints when the other party not interested. Keep it professional and focus on delivering a good experience and a safe ride
"How many people I live with? That would always have me answering, “5 and 4 are always home. My house is so crazy!” That way he isn’t tempted to come back."
Do you have voice recording turned on in your app? EVERYONE should be recording their rides. It makes reporting that much easier
Not good. Report him
&quot;Match with certainty&quot;... Heart icons.. makes it look like a dating app.
At least it&#39;s not a scissors icon 🤣
🤣👏🏻
"Good for them, it’s sad this is the lengths we have to go but there will always be a power dynamic and the gross few that take advantage of that."
Im not sure i have had more than 1 lady driver. ..... it&#39;s going to be a long time for pu and lady drivers now drive farther than men to go chase fewer rides.
"They&#39;ll start signing up in droves now, just because."
They won&#39;t
"I don’t think that’s how it’ll work. There’s a similar feature on Lyft and it’s a preference based on nearby drivers. If there are no available women driving nearby, a man will just be assigned."
Is it weird I sometimes I prefer men? I’m a woman but when I go to the airport or anything they’re usually so kind and offer to help me with the bags which is a big help and of course makes me want to tip more.
Babe I gotchu
herein lies the problem
Yes you&#39;re a pick me. An initiative you aren&#39;t forced into yet this is your response...is very telling.
"All because she said she likes how pleasant her experiences were with men and gave her opinion on this ordeal, a fairly lukewarm response without much controversy and somehow that makes her a pick-me and every woman should get a man to drive their rides just cuz she enjoys it? "
Can smell bro through this message
I&#39;m not a man..so
"don’t worry, we can tell by the immediate accusation towards another woman of being a “pick me” for having an alternative stance"
well you definitely act like one sooo...
They didn&#39;t say you were
Or I just want help with my bags and was just sharing why I don’t feel the need to as a viewpoint. I didn’t say anything bad about the initiative weirdo
"If you don&#39;t need it then it&#39;s not for you, pick me"
Yo chill
"I mean good, its reslly just weirdo conservatives who are upset about this thinking its useless and women are overreacting about the sexual harassment they get from these people."
Are the weirdo conservatives upset about this in the room with you now?
Her 2.0 in 3... 2... 1...
That New York Times story this morning lol
Say more words
Coming Soon: Caucasian Rides preference! Heil a taxi! ~ Tesla RoboTaxi
Consequence of men aren’t real men 
"How does this work if the woman has friends? Like, I’m with a girl, she books an Uber. Is there a “there are men in my group” checkbox”?"
They’ll probably charge the riders more and said women drivers will not get the upcharge.
I’ve been saying we need this for years. I don’t feel comfortable riding with a male driver especially at night.
"Good. I want everyone to be safe especially women. I wonder if Uber drivers can also vet or set a preference to who they pick up? To be fair I’ve mostly had good people but of course, have had the odd nutcase which made me question this gig."
"Drivers can vet by using an accurate rating system. I don’t pick up anybody below a 4.7 rating man, woman or whatever. At least in my market, it’s fairly accurate and that’s what I look at."
"The problem is the drivers do <em>not</em> accurately or even fairly use the rating system. It is nowhere consistent between drivers, and you even get the oddball that I argued with on another forum that <em>insists</em> a 3 should be the neutral score and so that is what he gives out. 😒"
Thanks. Didn’t know that so will pay more attention to this.
Can I choose not to drive women? They tip less often than men in my experience.
"Do they sexually harass you and force trauma onto you? Because thats why women want this, because men literally do this to women when theyre trapped in a car with them. It happens all the fucking time. "
What does this have to do with the guy saying they tip less in his experience?
"As a gay man, I have been sexually harassed by multiple women. It&#39;s annoying that some women see my lack of desire for them as a reason to physically assault me."
By female uber drivers? Are you unaware of how rare that is?
What exactly is the issue with adding a preference system both ways?
"No, but they do accuse things when things aren’t really there. I prefer driving men because I don’t need to drive in fear."
XD thats a wicked statement if it&#39;s true.
Are you a woman?
Wish there was option for men only Ubers though. and I could decline women without affecting cancelation rate.
I&#39;d definitely prefer women drivers
Is this not discriminatory? 😣 I mean go ahead but with equality and shit recently - seems a little out of place. lol
It&#39;s not because it doesn&#39;t stop me or women from being picked up by women. If it allowed the driver to only drive female passengers it would likely be illegal. But a male passenger can still be picked up by a female preferring driver. The customer always has the right to discriminate legally. So the customer can always refuse to do business with anyone for any reason. I&#39;m a massage therapist and have had places hire me because they can&#39;t support more male therapists because so many massage customers prefer female therapist.
Don&#39;t care. I&#39;d rather have my wife and daughter discriminate vs possibly getting raped by a driver.
it’s a safety measure based on stats &amp; 10+ years of data. 
You’re gonna get a lot of downvotes for this from people who can’t explain why it isn’t. lol.
"Its pretty easy to explain brother. Girl uses Uber to not drink and drive or some such. Uber drivers tend to be kinda strange. Not all of them of course. A lot of girls biggest fear is being raped lr assaulted by a guy that doesn&#39;t understand no. We dont have to worry about being raped. Its just a different ballgame. Nothing to get offended about, kinda weird to be tbh"
Customers are allowed to discriminate.
"Yeah not sure where they were going with this. When you go to the store and choose one brand over another, you’re also discriminating. You can’t tell me why you choose Frosted Flakes over the 97 other brands of the exact same thing. But you do. "
So what happens when a MAGA woman driver declines a trans woman because &quot;I expected a woman&quot;?
Drivers are gonna get grosser and grosser the less and less you pay us Dara
"It’s doubtful that the woman driver is going to get any more money even though she is preferred and uber is making a profit off of this option ; men make more money on jobs that require having Brawn , but women won’t make more money for being safe and kind"
Car accidents buffed by 30%
"So as a man, I can select a woman driver? That&#39;s fantastic."
LOL
...this is for DRIVERS selecting RIDERS?
"As an Uber driver, I will identify as a woman now. I only want to give women rides."
"I understand the motivations behind it, but this is illegal discrimination. As a business, you can&#39;t refuse to provide a service to someone just because of their gender. And you are operating a business as an Uber driver."
"Wow. Your understanding of the law, this preference setting &amp; its application is deeply flawed. And by flawed, I mean wrong"
“When I cash out they take half of it” what do you mean by this? What you make is what you take home.
Yeah that was literally the stupidest comment I’ve seen yet…”when I cash out they take half of it”…yeah if you’re cashing out a $2.50 balance idiot…and idk how you would even get a $2.50 balance…
They&#39;d already cashed out then someone from an earlier ride tipped $2.50?
Yeah it would have to be something like that…unless some of these crappy markets that ppl here bitch about have rides that pay $2.50 lol….
No need to be rude
"lol you new drivers are so cute. You act like the older drivers don’t know how much they take. The rider agrees to what they pay. You agree to what you are getting paid. If you don’t like what you are getting for a ride, don’t take the ride. You have to look at it as what you are getting paid, not what the rider is paying. Because Uber doesn’t give a shit if you don’t like their cut. You have to learn what rides are worth the offered pay. That’s how older drivers make money."
Exactamundo
"$34 for 20 mins, 19 miles on the highway with cruise control set? Dont mind if i do 💅"
I can’t wrap my head around how so many idiots think that the fare paid has anything to do with what a driver gets paid.
"I don’t know what markets these people drive in…I’ve done 11k rides, my percentage always hovers around 62% of what riders pay…with tips it goes to about 65% because we drivers do get 100% of tips…maybe other markets are different idk…Uber taking 38% is still high but if you do select rides it ain’t as bad as everyone makes it out to be here…"
"I never really see any rhyme or reason to it. On average, I’m seeing about 45-55% of the total fare. And while I’ve gotten screwed with some 30% cuts, I’ve also been on the receiving end of the 70-80% cut."
Yeah but at least the slave can burn the factory with the supervisor inside. Also if you haven&#39;t been burn by Uber before you would care. But you know this is true yet you use IPhones anyways.
"Yeah, I use an iPhone. Because it would be almost impossible for me to live my life in a way where I’m not consuming something that came to me by way of exploitation."
"Yes and you still help those companies everyday still by buying all these things like IPhone and name brand stuff instead of mom and pop shop. You agree to it that you continue doing it and then say it&#39;s not your fault. Even God doesn&#39;t like those that stay silent when injustice is being done. Your weakness shows. No wonder women in your country are tired of weak men. Where are Spartacus, where are those founding fathers, Where are those brave cowboys in the US that fought against injustice. Where are the Men of valor in biblical times. That just have tears and sweat on thier brows and blood fought for a better tomorrow. I know you will always going to be weak if you follow fools and brute that promise and drill you tired use you as trash. Where is all that motivation. that made men go against the state. Rebel alliance type people. Oh wait you sold yourself to the slave owner agian and now they dispose of you with Ai. The money you have is worthless because it&#39;s not in the gold standard and yet you use it. If we all collectively come together and decide that money is worthless, then the government loses and all its power is gone. The rest of the world is starting to do that. And that&#39;s why now we have so many homeless, and they think that just getting people who are immigrants out of the country is what&#39;s gonna help this country. But it&#39;s not If this continues the country, you know, of as the United States will fall not by a calamity of a Volcano. But because of a economic crisis that the orange man has created and this whole government has been rotten to the core. I hope I turned into it Admiral Yi from Korea. And get out of this place. Start promoting companies like empower then. I came from another country, and I can guarantee you. This is the worst country ever. The only thing it has is security, but that is dying out because of all the money. It owes."
Because it’s almost as if each individual does what best benefits them. It’s called human nature grow the fuck up.
"I’m kind of new to it, so it was shocking to see how much they take. As a driver, I just get a notification saying “$20 to pick up someone 3 blocks from my location” I don’t know where they’re driving. And it says the name of ONE person. Out of that $20, they take half. I’m stunned to find out they also take half of what the customer originally pays. Its crazy."
Sounds like you’re not in the US. Because they don’t take half of the price they’re showing you. You only see the real price of the fare if you look for it. And they bury that off to the side because they don’t want people seeing how little they’re getting paid out of the total fare.
"Yeah where are you? Kuala Lumpur? You get a notification saying what the rider is paying and not what you are getting? And you don’t know the duration or destination of the ride? I really find that hard to believe. Here in DC, we see what WE are getting, where the pickup is, where the destination is, so we know all the parameters — who cares what the rider is paying? You can find that out later. You must be very new to it or live in some third world place where Uber operates very differently…I would never drive under those circumstances…"
Yea except those workers at the factory dont use their own raw materials and machinery to the build those iphones😵‍💫 the key thing you are forgetting is we are basically also using our own car to provide the service.
"On AVERAGE, uber takes 35% of my fares. Its in my weekly statement. But it is not 35% of EVERY fare. Sometimes they take half or more. Sometimes I get the whole thing. I&#39;ve seen it both ways."
"Correct, and if you don’t take long trips it can be even better."
Yes — this is true for me as well…none of this “uber is taking 60-80%…for me they take about 35% as well on average…maybe some of these people either just lie or live in horrible Uber markets or just don’t know which rides to accept
"This is the stupidest, most erroneous post I’ve seen yet…"
"I agree, Having talked to a hundred uber drivers the entire post is just trash."
Genuine question because I don&#39;t drive Uber and am just curious.
"They don’t take half of it — OP is an idiot — they charge 1.50 I think for instant pay…if you wait till the end of the week, they transfer it to your bank for free…takes 1 extra day"
No they don&#39;t even pay taxes they put on the driver. They put cash out fees for when you take out money. They try to get you in with control business cards too. So they can get more fee and keep an eye what money you make.
"They don’t put on cash out fees unless you want instant transfers and it’s a couple bucks. Weekly transfers or going from uber plus card to a bank transfer are free for the 3 business day transfer. Cry more about it, but be honest."
So you agree that there is fees then at the same time It&#39;s not worth it plus it&#39;s the dry season because no tourism have return because of the orange orangutang.
"Uber takes about 60% of the fare. There are some extremely rare times when, believe it or not, in a huge surge, where U er will pay the driver almost the entire fare. But that lasts for a few minutes and only during a full solar eclipse, if you catch my drift. I&#39;ve seen it."
I’ve done 11k rides and uber takes about 40% of the fare
"And that’s without tips — when they tip and choose to pay more, driver gets the whole tip and Uber’s share drops to about 35-38% in my case"
"So greatful for my market. Between talking to my riders and a passengers, I&#39;ve figured out I&#39;m getting about 64% of the fare in my market."
"Uber is a horrible, greedy and awful company that will hopefully burn in hell. They treat their drivers like slaves"
"Maybe you’re in a bad market, but a week is an awfully small sample size. I consistently make 25-30 an hour and pay almost no taxes, so I keep most of what I earn. I drive a hybrid to keep fuel costs down and track miles automatically with an app. Between the IRS mileage deduction and subtracting Uber fees, I reduced my taxable income by over 50 grand last year. My goal for every ride request is to make 50 cents a minute ($30/hr). I ignore any that don’t come close (and there are a lot). Knowing how hard it is to make money at this nowadays, you just need to work smart and take advantage of every benefit available to you. That being said, I’m almost 68 and ready to chuck this gig after 7 years. Good luck!"
Well said…these numbers are accurate
"Factor in the zero taxes, complete flexibility (what other job can you do literally whenever you want, as much or as little?), and idk about anyone else but I meet so many nice riders, like 99.5% of them…yes, we kill our cars with miles…but I don’t even call it “work”; it’s just driving…not horrible like everyone here portrays it…yes, Uber is greedy as fuck, but what company isn’t?…basically Uber has this massive platform, we can make a few bucks, of course we don’t get rich, if it gets unbearable then just don’t drive..you are not an employee…at least you have the option"
"Yes, I forgot to mention the freedom and flexibility!"
"I mean, you do have to pay taxes at the end of the year, but otherwise yeah"
"If you aren’t writing off all of your 1099 income with miles and other expenses, then you aren’t doing it right…unless you want to show some token bottom line net income"
What app do you use to track mileage?
They give you a printout of your miles…start there and “embellish” it if you need to…you shouldn’t pay income tax in this stuff
"MilesIQ. I thinks it’s about 100 a year, which you can write off."
"How else is the Vanguard group and all the other investors supposed to make their billions!?! Cmon! Just stay quiet, and continue to feed the beast /s"
You know you can open a vanguard account and be one of those investors.
As long as monkeys are willing to drive for Uber they will make peanuts.
This is why driverless taxis are more expensive I guess since they don’t pay the drivers or have to buy cars on normal uber.
I&#39;m surprised more people dont get this. If they had to bear ALL the expenses themselves they would never do it.
"Supply and demand. Way too many people willing to Uber, so costs are low."
"As a public company, they have to show continuing profits and meet analyst guidelines or else they will take the stock. Uber sucks."
"Count your blessings, I’d be happy with 14 out of 35.. down in florida if they charge customer 35 it means am getting around 11-12 if not less.. really varies … at times they conceal surge or make it look like surge for the customer yet drivers be sitting around trying to figure out where are the people! … they do that especially at the airport. So many ways they are skimming both riders and drivers"
"If you are consistently getting 14 out of 35 then Florida sucks…not the case here in the DMV; Uber takes about 38-40% of the fare in rides I do, and that percentage is reduced by tips to about 35%…"
I average 27 to 30 per hour and pay little in taxes. I Drive 2 to 3 days per week. Use a tracking app for mileage. Middle TN
"In 2015 I was going to make a paper about this and how these companies are using tech and algorithms to literally enslave people in many ways without any respect to any laws, basically lawless ! No one is looking at their algorithms and they are using this to do what ever they want, by the time the laws adapt, it will be too late. They actually do this in some countries when they start, they break the law and pay fines on behalf of drivers just to get it started."
literally enslave people 
always has been.
My acceptance rate is 15% with 5.00 rating at 5000 trips. I used to care about all of that when I was a newbie and pay was a little bit better.
"So the way that algorithm works is you need to work more than 3 or 5 trips. Just 2 hours deep into the algorithm, it will start pumping out 60/40 and will throw you a bone every once in a while for you to drive fifteen minutes for pick up only to drop just down the road and make more than it cost them on the ride. Nice ones, especially if you work 4 to 5 straight hours. It does eliminate the weekender, but you know they want people working full time. I generally can make $ 1500 a week and still take a day or 2 off working standard 40 hours. People in this Economy would love to have that kind of Financial security, but yes, you do have to pay about thirty to fifty dollars and gas per day, but It comes with a territory you are a driver."
"Instead of declining 5 to take 1, how about accepting ten in a row.... I usually average thirty to thirty five an hour in a average market. It may not seem like they&#39;re not rewarding you for the small ones, but do a couple in a row and you will see a big difference. Think about it that your mother is just down the street and just needs a ride to the store and back or just needs a ride home."
"That&#39;s one of the things I like about Lyft vs. Uber. With Lyft I can see the entire fare and the fees that were taken out before I got my cut. I make more per ride, but get less rides than I do with Uber. Uber has a larger customer base"
You don’t need to give a damn about how much your boss makes.
Why do they take half of your $14 when you cash out?
Y by we n you have to pay taxes and the gas and upkeep for your car with the little you get after providing great personal customer service
"Yeah, its insane. Fare pays $15, I get like $4.30, lmao"
You’re subsidizing their research to replace everyone with autonomous vehicles
yay more whinging <del>heroes</del> uber drivers.
"If youre talking about through the app, no. You can however schedule a trip every day so you could like wake up, schedule your trip, and then it would be ready and waiting when you are done with class. As a driver i really like scheduled trips because riders are usually punctual, the fare is good, and it allows me to plan things during my day around it"
Thank you!
Youre welcome!
It would be cheaper to find a local driver service and have them do it
In India you can hire a driver for like up to 12hrs a day i was shocked but in US not really only scheduled rides
"Probably because in India they have less regulations so more things are allowed, But I&#39;m speaking in terms of for the safety of workers, I have no idea if it&#39;s the same regulations that they have with truck drivers in the US, But it&#39;s probably not too much different."
Doesn’t matter it was only seven bucks you should get it refunded 
"Also if the ride is canceled you can&#39;t rate him a one star. Email Uber and let them know you were charged for the ride that he refused to take you on, and that you lost at least 1/2 hour waiting for a new ride. "
"Ugh, no. I tip well, <em>after</em> the ride. I definitely don’t want to condition drivers to not take me where I’m going unless I hand over cash up front. Hope this doesn’t catch on."
It’s only a thing in this sub and it’s hilarious that they keep trying to make it a thing in the real world
Agree on everything except the $5 bribe — customers should NOT have to bribe drivers to do what they contractually agreed to do.
"Lmao you drivers keep trying to make this pre-tip thing happen, and in cash? Absolutely not. So now if you do bullshit you already have the money? You are delusional. You get your tip after you show you’re a competent driver."
"Nobody has ever tipped me up front but I would be (quietly) annoyed if they did, I want to get tipped based on how well I deliver my service as a driver not in some attempt to placate me."
We lost to half an hour because they’re waiting for him to cancel instead of canceling it themselves.
"He should have cancelled immediately, I don’t know in this case but some riders don’t even know how to cancel it. The driver is supposed to cancel if they have an issue with the ride anyways."
"OP said they deliberately didn’t cancel, because they wanted to harm the driver."
"Yes but the driver shouldn’t have accepted and should have canceled either way and is supposed to, not to mention what he did is legitimately fraud."
"Doesn’t matter. My point is, the OP hurt themselves by being vindictive toward the driver."
"And vice versa. Waiting 30 minutes to cancel for $7 is absurdly dumb, he could have taken the ride got the full fare and came back downtown and continued to get the short rides he wanted instead he was vindictive toward the riders, lied to them, and committed fraud which can get him kicked off of the platform all for $7 lol"
My comment has nothing to do with the driver; I’m only talking about the passenger. I couldn’t care less what the driver did.
"The whole point of the post is about the driver so your point is irrelevant. I agree they lost money because they didn’t cancel and waited for the driver to do so, but they aren’t supposed to have to cancel the ride if the driver has an issue with the ride."
"Yes, because the driver should be harmed in this situation. “I just don’t want to do it” after you accepted the job should come with consequences, including deactivation if you do it enough times."
"The point is, the OP made the choice to do something vindictive and that’s why they wasted their own time. And that’s my only point."
"That’s the only recourse we really have against drivers is to ding you a bunch of times until you get deactivated for shitty behavior. I don’t care if you don’t like it, there’s ten people in waiting to take your spot when you get deactivated. Driver should be accountable, full stop."
I don’t even drive for Uber lol. You’re barking up the wrong tree.
"It is an extremely high level of entitlement for a driver to ask the rider to cancel. In fact, I think it is instant deactivation if reported in the right way."
It&#39;s possible dude is also a Lyft driver.
"If our acceptance rate is under 85%, we can’t see the end destination. We can only assume about how far the ride is based on the upfront dollar amount if we see it."
"I have a 8%, up from 3 last week and I can see where we are going. It’s market dependent."
"Correct. As of the end of May, most markets are now up+front markets which means you get to see the time, distance, and approximate destination. However, some markets are still rate card markets, which means depending on your acceptance rate you will either see just time and sometimes distance, or you might just see time, or in most cases you will not see any information about the destination <em>at all</em>. "
"The driver shouldn’t accept a ride just to cancel it. Specially if his ratings are low anyways. That’s on him not keeping his rating up. I have a 100% acceptance rate and a 0% cancellation rate, and I’ve been driving for uber and Lyft for 10 years almost."
I don’t know what any of that means rate card etc. I just know I decline anything that doesn’t give me all the info in the ping.
"Yes cuz your market shows you all the info. Some markets just legit show “pick up Anthony” THATS IT. No other info. I’m in Cali so I see distance, pay, location etc. this isn’t that hard to wrap your head around."
"Ya I remember picking up someone 5 mins away, getting to them, then as I accepted the trip then it showed a 2 hour ride. I said yolo and went with it but can’t really plan things that way anymore."
Which is unfortunate and predatory cause you’re gonna more than likely dead head a lot of your way home unless you get incredibly lucky.
I am going to try to make a post tomorrow with screenshots because I see a lot of folks (especially riders) have never seen the different levels of info that drivers get.
You definitely should.
My acceptance been under 85 for a long time and I can see where I’m going to end up at.
Sometimes it shows and sometimes it doesn&#39;t. I don&#39;t think market or AR are factors.
Quite literally the market and AR are THE factors lol
"Both are the exact factors. In some markets like Illinois, they&#39;re legally obligated to give you all the trip info upfront regardless of your status on the app. Anywhere that doesn&#39;t have that requirement in place, I believe you have to get Platinum (?) Uber Pro status to see that info."
"Yes. But I&#39;m saying, at times, the route doesn&#39;t appear. It could be a glitch, or those factors don&#39;t affect it. I do drive in Illinois."
"Oh yeah, it definitely glitches and doesn&#39;t show the lines on occasion, but in those instances (in my experience, at least), it still tells you the cross streets and city(s) for pickup/dropoff"
It’s market dependent and locations i e seen it sometimes downtown but not others but people in Jersey have posted they never get them so who know?
"Either I&#39;d see the route all the time, or not at all. Most times, I see the route, only a few times I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know what causes either."
[deleted]
Nope.
"This is very wrong, echoing the other comment."
"Okay. Then explain to me why, while driving in the Chicagoland area and an AR of 30%, I sometimes get to see the route to the request and sometimes not."
Chicago specifically gets different perks then the surrounding area. The only reason I know this is cuz I had this exact discussion last night involving markets with someone else. If you give me a moment I can give you receipts of the post discussing discrepancy if you would like!
Sure. Any info is good info.

I&#39;ll check it out.
I had someone cancel on me because she didn’t want to go downtown. Made me super late to my class because I waited 15 minutes for her to even arrive. Professor was pissed/cold called me right when i got in bc it was law school lol
"You can&#39;t cancel a ride thats already begun (he swiped right to begin ride). All he can do is complete ride, but if he does that, that means he&#39;s almost certainly going to get a 1 star rating. "
I feel like so many of the conflicts between drivers and passengers boil down to Uber being a shitty company
"Almost all of them, I&#39;d wager. The first couple times I had a Share passenger multi-match, the dude who got in first was super mad about everyone else getting dropped off first until I told him Uber controls all of that and I dont even get to say no to them adding extra legs after the first acceptance."
Pretty much. 
"On Long Island it doesnt even show us the amount we will earn for the ride, just shows how far away the pickup is. Its very frustrating."
"Rating doesn’t matter at all, it tells us the time and distance of the ride."
"Uber doesn&#39;t show the drivers the trip details until after the riders are in the car. Its a terrible system they have created where drivers are but in awkward situations like this, where they have to accept rides not knowing where its going or how much it will pay. It really sucks in areas like Long Island, where you might get stuck with a ride to manhatten, where you cant even pick up a paid ride back, and will be responsible to pay the toll coming back out of your own pocket."
Imagine that you go to work and you do not know how much they go going to pay you or the amount of work you need to do. Then imagine that they want you to work 10 hours for $8. Then they get mad at you because you didn&#39;t want to do it and you get in trouble.
Then go take a regular part time job?
"Yeah, as a single woman, I would never do that as my main job. Couldn’t afford to pay rent."
then who would be driving you around op ?
"A taxi driver, that does its job."
You aren&#39;t wrong taxis are getting more popular again. If your taxis don&#39;t take 2 hours to arrive after calling them it might be best.
Then why are you getting an Uber them? Call a taxi and quit your bitching. By the way I was on your side until you started with this line of bullshit.
"I&#39;m getting an Uber because it&#39;s usually cheaper and I don&#39;t have to Google a number for a cab. And I&#39;m making some extra Air Miles. Like I&#39;m sorry but the logic that I&#39;m somehow suppose to hop in and out of cars, get billed and do that until a benevolent independent contractor feels graceful to give me a paid ride on the ride sharing app is dumb."
Another good reason not to tip
guess you haven&#39;t been paying attention to anything that has been written above.
Should definitely ask for a refund.
so does uber lol drivers fault for not wanting to check 😂
No way 😭🤣🤣🤣
Yes lol 🤣 it doesn’t give you an exact address but it shows you how much miles the trip is and it shows on the map where you’re going (you can zoom in and see where the drop off is at)
Uber does not always show. It depends upon market and also on acceptance rate in some markets.
Self driving ride share nationally can’t come soon enough. It’s a godsend in San Francisco and I don’t know a single person who’s taken one that ever wants to go back to this bullshit.
I would never ever get in a car not driven by an actual person that scares the hell out of me
It&#39;s people who should terrify you. 
For real spiritual cap is just rere- cause humans will 100% more than likely try some weird shit with you
Waymo’s are safer than human drivers. 
"Unfortunately Uber indeed doesn&#39;t always show the destination. I had once to accept a ride on the blind like this and once I arrived I realized the ride was farther than my car range. What really saved me was a nail I saw on my tire, so I couldn&#39;t really take the rider from that point anyway. Rider was pissed, but what can I do?"
"Drivers may be independent contractors but they then have to honor contracts . This is the rule—- Drivers are not allowed to refuse trips after seeing the destination—they are contractually obligated to complete rides they accept, unless a valid policy reason applies (for example, safety, rider misconduct, etc. What you can do about it is another question —-"
Straight up false! drivers are not contractually obligated to complete any ride. Just cause they accepted the ride in the app does not mean they have to complete it. Where would that end? Can a passenger keep just changing the destination and keep the driver on the hook indefinitely? No that would be ridiculous. The driver is not a slave. They can choose not to do the job even if they have accepted the request
"Nobody said about changing the destination. Here is the rule …. Uber specifically lists as a breach: “once aware of the destination, cancelling the ride, explicitly asking the rider to cancel the ride or behaving in an obstructive way to the natural flow of a trip in order to encourage the rider to cancel the trip” Seems clear to me."
Please cite your source
The T&amp;Cs you signed to become a driver 
Wrong? At any point a driver can pull over and cancel a ride in a “safe” drop off point.
Obviously they can but if they repeatedly did that and never gave a ride then they obviously would not keep the account would they
This is patently false? I’m doing uber/lyft for a month before I move for some extra cash and at any time I can pull over “in a safe location” and cancel the ride. 
Unfortunately service is going to get worse.
Next time cancel immediately with driver refused ride as reason. Makes it very easy to get your cancellation fee back
"They don’t tell us where we’re going, and penalize us for declining rides. He’s right, spending 25 minutes in traffic for $3 isn’t worth it."
Driverless cars can’t come soon enough. Drivers have their own agendas - rightfully so - and this will let the consumer pick the option that suits them best
In some markets Uber purposely does this when events are happening because it knows drivers won’t accept event rides if the driver was hooked up to Apple Play or Car Play the end destination is not shown also a driver can camel upon arrival for various reasons including unsafe locations (you can’t say what is or isn’t unsafe to another person). Uber has been repeatedly surveyed about distance issues because as a driver 3 different towns spanning 40 miles isn’t a reduced preference area so driver dictate their own area manually because the apps preset preference area are ridiculous.
"Also Uber absolutely shows us where we are picking up and dropping off, its just sort of vague, and if you take a second to study it, chances are youll miss the trip because another driver will grab it quicker. Either you know the map and can generally guess where youll wind up, or you take the ride and wind up suprised. To actually reach your pickup location and then decline is wild to me though. You&#39;d cancel as soon as you saw, and not checking before you go to pick up is dumb as rocks."
Some places still don’t show destination. Especially non US places. Which I’m assuming this is based on the 17 kilometer description.
I no longer use independent contractors Spend the few extra dollars and hire a real driver AKA TAXI the driver who does a job gets paid to the job and will not chase you down cause $5 dollars is not a big enough tip . Hell no I boycott these companies. 
"Honestly, I support gig workers (they should def have better rights and benefits) but some of them are shitty ppl."
You said “we” just order an uber on the other persons phone and wait him out
"They can totally do that, but we are supposed to cancel it ourselves if it&#39;s our reason."
"I’ve had one pull up and as I went to get in, cancel and leave. Think he tried to do the scam where they start rides and drive off, but I have PIN numbers for my trips"
Happened to me once I was going south and the guy was going north and told me he couldn’t take me lol
"He can cancel for whatever reason he feels. The reason he took so long to actually cancel is because if we wait a certain amount of time we get a cancellation fee. If you two were already in the car I would very much advise that you call uber support and explain what happened because he can get reprimanded for that and potentially taken off the app since that is fraud for him to wait till you’re there then cancel on you and wait to get the fee. He makes drivers look bad and uber does show us where it’s going ahead of time. It shows the distance, estimated time and estimated fare amount we are supposed to make dependent on traffic and tips."
Sounds like he never started the ride and waited until he could get a cancel fee and then left. In some areas uber doesn’t tell the driver where they’re going but in most states they do. Either way he shouldn’t have done that to y’all. If he was already there he should’ve just done the ride.
"yeah they can cancel n you hafta call back n report what happened to get a refund, it is a crap system for all, yes. good drivers that want to stay in an area have the filtration option to filter that out so sounds like a rookie driver, but yeah, when it pops up, the offer, if on another ride may not be able to see it, but, common sense and the price one would guess its further out of town. same if not on another ride, if you stare too long its gone to see on the map where exactly, but, same, thr amount and the distance line, common sense should make it obvious, as well as the earnings number, that its outta town. I suspect maybe multi app if he was sly and a higher offer popped up elsewhere. But still some wrong sh.. to do really. im a rider n driver n would never cancel one i accepted."
"Well, that is how it&#39;s your problem. We&#39;re all in this together. Uber could (relatively) easily allow the drivers to set up area limits, etc so that the rides are guaranteed to be what the driver is willing to do. The real issue is that it is a dangerous distraction to check the 8 points on info for each ride within a few seconds WHILE YOU&#39;RE DRIVING. Nothing is going to change with any institution like this until we form bodies of elected reps of riders and drivers. 1to1Representation."
"I don&#39;t understand how &#39;we&#39;re all in this together&#39;. I requested a service that was very exactly defined. If you&#39;re a driver, you accept that this come with the territory of being a subcontractor. Picking and choosing is unfair to both your customers, who waste their time because of your greediness, and other drivers, who are actually doing what they&#39;re mandated to do and not picking what has a better distance/$ ratio."
Picking and choosing is exactly what makes it an independent contractor
"The point here is that the IC “picking and choosing” should be happening during the ride acceptance process, not after. Once the IC has positively accepted the work, it is a completely different ballgame."
Sorry life doesn’t work like in your imagination.
What imagination? Uber drivers agree to terms of access to the platform and can face negative consequences for doing exactly what OPs driver did. That isn’t my imagination.. it’s reality. They have the right to choose and they also have the right to the consequences when they accept the work and don’t perform.
"Your imagination where drivers can’t cancel a ride after accepting. Sorry, real life doesn’t work like that, maybe you could cry a little about it."
You seem well adjusted. There are very few things in life that someone can be forced to do; that’s obviously correct and you are being a pedant anchoring to that as your argument.
Ooooh sorry I can not let you in my car for any reason except discrimination. Maybe you need to be better adjusted to reality. 
"again, be mad at Uber for not showing drivers the trip details ahead of time, not the driver."
Some markets you don’t see any information on where the passenger wants to go. Uber will only tell you how many minutes you need to drive to pick up the passenger and how many minutes the ride they are requesting is. This is all the information you have to make a decision sometimes people want to go an area you might think is busy but the driver knows this area rarely produces a ride especially at a certain time of night you may be pulling them away from an area they are guaranteed to have steady demand and possibly surge prices. Drivers just trying to make money by turning down your garbage ride you can’t blame them.
"This is not like taxi service. Taxi drivers receive higher pay while rideshare drivers only net about 30-40% of the rider fare. Also on some markets, drivers cannot see trip destination nor net pay at request screen, meaning they won&#39;t know where they&#39;re going until rider is picked up and driver begins the trip. Also, you as the customer are the rideshare company&#39;s customer, not the driver. The drivers are independent contractors meaning they can choose to accept or decline requests. Even if they accept, many drivers change their mind and cancel to fish for a better one (some also drive for Lyft and have that app running to see if they get a favorable request which is a bit rare because they&#39;re trash like Uber)."
That is BS. No one is forcing that person to drive for Uber.
no one is forcing Uber to not show their drivers the rides before they accept them. Refocus your anger at the right party.
In some places the city literally does force this. Just like cab drivers can be fined for refusing rides from Manhattan to Brooklyn.
"Yeah true, bills and rent are optional, you really hit the nail on the head there."
"The real problem was when the government passed that law specifying that exactly and only those 248,000 people could and would ever be Uber drivers. Because that’s when a driver’s choice of career became the public’s problem. "
Uber customers benefit from artificially deflated pricing. Someone please tell me what is the average salary for an Uber driver after deducting the IRS mileage reimbursement?
"There is a big difference between a housekeeper cleaning a trashed room, and an Uber driver being forced to drive 1 hour and 1 hour back for $20 and pay the $10 toll coming back out of their own pocket. haha"
Are you oblivious to the current economic atmosphere in America right now?
"I’ve got bills, but no car – can I say I’m an Uber driver and you’ll send me money?"
"That’s a lot of words to say you’re entitled and hate poor people, but go off, king"
"Everything you&#39;re saying is spot on and packed with logic, and that simpleton has absolutely no intelligent or worthy response to any of it."
"All your little toys and video games are optional, though. Exactly how much rent do you pay your parents, whom you clearly live with? They almost certainly bought your car, no?"
"No, I’m an adult. You should start acting like one."
"Sure thing, I&#39;ll start by getting a salaried job, not owning a zillion toys and video games, and not whining for tips on Reddit. Oh wait! I nailed all three years ago. When do you plan to start?"
"Not everyone was born into the privilege you were, lol - I can tell by your attitude and sense of entitlement. Miss me with that bootstraps bullshit, you pampered child. If you&#39;re provided with a service, you provide a tip. This is the social-contract."
That still does not give him the right to charge me for a ride I&#39;ve never taken. The whole thing is so unprofessional.
"agree. you should not be charged, and if he wanted to cancel he should have cancelled."
"be mad at Uber, not the driver"
"In many cities, like New York, it is in fact a taxi service. Taxi drivers, including Uber drivers, are regulated by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. What he did was a violation. Before you leave the car, take a picture of his license if the jurisdiction requires it, and file a report. In NYC, the driver and customer will have to appear at an in-person hearing, and he will have his license suspended if found guilty of this."
"leave the guy alone. Its an Uber issue, not the diver."
"But, the driver is a human who, in this case, did not want to do the service. He is a real human being in your world and this is how you are in this WITH him. This is how this is YOUR problem, because the human owner of the car doesn&#39;t want to drive the direction YOU are going. "
"Driver here, he can refuse to do the ride, but its absolute bullshit to wait for 30 mins to collect, feigning like they were going to take the ride to receive money for not taking the ride that he refused to do. If you dont want to take the ride, you swallow it and just take a cancel that&#39;ll be cleared in a day or two from your ratings anyways."
"Yes. Obviously. But, we still have the real problem of no enforcement. I was trying to get at a solution, but this community has asked me to leave and I will."
"The driver is scummy. He charged me for that &#39;ride&#39; (aka us entering and leaving the car, and how long he traveled away from us), for which I now have to initiate a refund. That means he didn&#39;t cancel, thought I wouldn&#39;t see it or dispute it. I see how it is my problem, but I don&#39;t see why it <em>should</em>."
"He didn’t charge you for the ride, you just have a pending charge that will fall off. No one’s obligated to do anything for you. The driver is completely within their rights to not drive you. Your post is just dripping with entitlement."
No one’s obligated to do anything for you
Yeah they do.
"No. No one&#39;s obligated to do anything for you. It&#39;s a two-way street, despite so many drivers here being such precious little divas."
[deleted]
"No, I think a guy should chauffeur me through town for whatever the company he&#39;s choosing to sub-contract himself to is paying him. "
"The driver is an ass for doing that, they are obliged to take the customer to their destination once the ride is accepted. Zero entitlement on behalf of the op. They hired a service, paid money, service accepted the job then bailed. 100% fault on the driver for having no intention to do the job they were hired for."
"So, no matter what the destination is or what the passenger does, the driver is obligated? That straight up Ludacris, and completely false. It’s crazy that you would even take that stance. The driver isn’t obligated to do anything. Literally nothing. They just can’t cancel for discriminatory reasons. That that’s all. After they start the trip, they can choose to end the trip at any point. Uber tells says as much. Just cause you want something to be one way, doesn’t mean that it actually is. Try actually living in reality. You’re up in some fantasy land."
You’re stretching so hard……. Let’s not play “what if” and stick to OP’s original comment.
A lazy drivers favourite word: entitlement
"Entitlement, fascist, racist, Maga, misogynist, these are the go to words that self absorbed and lazy people use when they can’t prove a point or win an argument. At one point, these were social media trigger words that were so overly repeated - now they hold very little weight, and are not very effective."
"OP, these are the kinds of people who agree with you, lmao"
"The passenger doesn’t pay the driver for the ride. The passenger pays Uber. Uber doesn’t have any cars so they subcontract the job out to a driver. The driver can then decide they don’t want to do the job. Sorry that you think that drivers are indentured servants, and beholden into the passenger."
"Being pedantic doesn’t change the point at all, you do realise that?"
"The only thing you would be losing is a little bit of time, not losing any money. You’re using a budget service, God forbid if you’d have to wait a bit longer to get a driver who wants to take you. Want better service? Stop being cheap and pony up for a professional car service. But you won’t,you use Lyft because it’s cheap, but you expect limousine service for barely bus fare money."
"The whole entire point of this post is that the rider got charged for a ride the driver wasn’t willing to go on…. You saying you only lose time and not money is not true. If it was then this post wouldn’t exist, brainbox. Did you actually read the post or?"
They’re not being paid unless they actually do the job. It’s not like the driver keeps the money if they cancel.
"Drivers are self employed. Just like any business owner, they need to be either professional or out of business. "
"Man, if that ain&#39;t the pot calling the kettle black!"
&quot;Paid service providers are not obligated to provide paid-for services.&quot; Uber driver business philosophy in a nutshell.
Welcome to the Uber app buddy 😜
Picking and choosing is exactly what makes it an independent contractor
Yes. The driver can do what they want with their car.
"But do they suffer a considerable/real penalty for making these decisions? I don&#39;t like my time being wasted, or my friend&#39;s."
No.
"For not cancelling themselves for a long period of time so you get charged ,yes? "
"They&#39;re independent contractors, not employees therefore no considerable punishment unless they were to drive recklessly or physically harm a rider."
"The driver would lose his taxi license for this in many cities, like New York. So there is considerable punishment. Without TLC license, he cannot drive for Uber, Lyft or anyone else"
He still charged me for it.
"He didn&#39;t charge you, Uber did."
... and what does that distinction accomplish here?
"Report to Uber again as the driver was committing fraud. He cant both refuse to do the ride and not cancel it himself. If he told you to cancel that&#39;s also against the terms and conditions We have enough drivers as is so we don&#39;t need scammers, cheats, and tricksters on the road., He refused to do the ride but behaved in a manner as if he was going to, to fraudulently collect money."
"Your gripe is with Uber, not the driver."
...no. Dude canceled us because he got greedy.
So? Why should a driver do a trip when they will lose money. Not everyone is in an upfront market.
They aren&#39;t losing money for that ride. They&#39;re just not making as much they think they could get by playing these games.
The driver has 0 control over if you get charged or refunded thats what the distinction accomplishes. You keep blaming the driver for the charge. When the driver did nothing regarding the charge is all on the uber app. 
It’s interesting you say they have zero control when drivers quite literally have the option of whether or not to charge a cancel fee after 7 minutes. (In my area and I would think many places). 
Reverse it as fraud.
"Oh, but it’s okay to waste the drivers time, got it 👍"
"How the fuck am i wasting their time by asking for a ride...? I am not asking to be dropped 2 streets down. Like, is the expectation here that I have to hop in cars until one finds the ratio of $/distancr is appropriate to him, while our time is just no part of the equation? Again, this was a pretty standard ride request."
"I used to uber for fun awhile back when I couldn’t sleep. Sorry OP, but if I got a ride when I’m getting ready to go home and it’s far, I’d cancel it and go home. Get mad all you want, the driver is an independent contractor and can do as he wishes. It’s his car, his rules. He doesn’t have to give you a ride if he doesn’t want to. Stop crying"
"This is the funniest Reddit thread I’ve ever seen. OPs main complaint isn’t the fact that the driver refused to take them, it’s that the driver refused to cancel. Yall are bending over backwards to misunderstand. "
Hahahahah! I re-read the entire thing. I need to just go back to sleep lol
"Unfortunately can’t download but it is here .. The official source for the Uber Platform Access Agreement, which governs the contractual relationship between Uber and its drivers—including their obligation to complete accepted rides—is available directly from Uber’s legal and regulatory documentation. The most relevant and up-to-date versions can be found at: • Uber’s U.S. Platform Access Agreement (sample, as of Jan 1, 2022): PDF direct from Uber"
"So from a passenger and old driver at one time, there is two sides to this coin, the driver can cancel a ride for any reason even if it&#39;s not reasonable it&#39;s there car, there business license if they need one and there time, I have many times refused someone a going to a hospital or ER and using is as a cheap taxi, way too much liability if things go side ways and they get worse, or the passenger is too drunk or has alchohol that they CANT bring in my car per laws, we&#39;re not a TAXI they have medallions and covered as a hired ride so yiu can legally drink in them like a limo, Uber doesn&#39;t have a commission license so we&#39;re different. On the other hand him accepting after looking at fair and gauging distance then mad it&#39;s not what they want is his fault not passengers. So it&#39;s a catch 22. He should cancel and move on and not try scam passenger for 5 bucks. Hope this helps"
So much anger in this thread. I’m going to take a shower. 🚿 I don’t feel good
"Uber drivers are independent contractors. If they don’t want to take the trip, it doesn’t matter what the reasoning is, they are allowed to do so."
"The only thing you would be losing is a little bit of time, not losing any money. You’re using a budget service, God forbid if you’d have to wait a bit longer to get a driver who wants to take you. Want better service? Stop being cheap and pony up for a professional car service. But you won’t,you use Lyft because it’s cheap, but you expect limousine service for barely bus fare money."
"Lol y’all are absolutely bonkers here. It’s why I never feel bad not tipping rideshare. Like you said, budget service :)"
17 km for $7 I would have cancelled too wtf is that for the driver
I believe that was the fee for cancellation
"The driver made a terrible mistake. He doesn&#39;t need to actually pick up the passengers to get paid. Just report in the app that he picked them up, then later report that he dropped them off. Uber is great for making money, but the passenger part is a hassle - skip it. Uber is good with this. They will charge the patsy - I mean customer - take their cut and pay the driver. Even if the customer complains, they will do nothing."
Blame Uber
"Drivers want to be employees and get the hourly pay and benefits and such. But they then dont realize that they then won&#39;t be independent then and dont get to decide which rides they do, who they pick up or where they go, or even the hours they get to work. It will basically be the end of rideshare if they were to be employees like that. "
Actually it’s your problem you had to wait..
I&#39;m going to go out in a limb here and presume English is perhaps not your first language?
Sounds like Uber should just include a part where you specify additional passengers or extra accommodations so that way if someone doesn&#39;t want to do it they can just avoid taking it at all
Yup! But the probably never will
"Not only that, but drivers probably won&#39;t look at it half the time, will just hit accept whatever is first on thier 6 rideshare apps"
They definitely will not as they are moving to self driving vehicles as soon as possible.
"It’s also possible to communicate this to the driver as soon as you have a driver assigned. Neither side is right in this scenario. If you’ve ever driven for ride shares, you’d understand. Iykyk"
"No I definitely get it. I would likely not feel comfortable assuming responsibility for a child&#39;s safety in my vehicle, or in safely transporting a disabled person if I wasn&#39;t already experienced in doing so properly. I think its completely reasonable to want fair warning about that"
Suggesting you should be allowed to deny someone service based on a disability is umm.. a problem... Like do you understand what you&#39;re saying?
"I&#39;m not saying they should be denied service, I&#39;m saying the app should allow customers to note if they have need of accommodation so that way someone who isn&#39;t prepared won&#39;t be the one agreeing to drive them, only finding out they lack the ability to do so until too late. Like I imagine an older or disabled person would prefer a car they can actually climb into, and that would have space for their wheel chair, walker, or whatever else they may have. How can drivers be prepared to accommodate what they don&#39;t know about?"
"No, suggesting that a customer should note their disability up front is all but ensuring they will be denied service. Here&#39;s the deal. If someone is disabled and calling for an Uber, odds are they don&#39;t need <em>you</em> to do anything, nor should they need to disclose that disability to you. People with disabilities are perfectly capable of handling themselves and making decisions for themselves. Those who need extra services are generally not looking for an Uber driver to provide that."
"Per the ADA, it&#39;s illegal if they&#39;re in the US... but I also understand feeling uncomfortable. Depending on the disability, they could be more fragile than your average traveler. &quot;Feeling nervous&quot; about inadvertently hurting someone and turning away someone disabled are not the same thing."
That’s why veyo exists now too. But I’ve gotten Lyfts designed specifically for disabled ppl through my insurance. It’s pretty cool.
As much as I get that it’s also not fair to have a low rating just bc I bring my cane or walker somewhere. All cars have been able to fit either or but I find my rating dips every time I have to bring a mobility aid.
"it’s illegal for uber to do. the drivers are 1099 and that means they can do whatever they want, within legal limitations and any contracts they signed with uber."
If you&#39;re taking work as a driver you should understand that will likely include all people and no one would expect they should alert you that they have a baby with them or that they&#39;re disabled. Perhaps consider delivering merchandise or food instead.
"So if someone orders a food that smells so bad that it stinks up the car you still do it? If someone tells you to carry them on your back you still do it? You can never under any circumstance say no to anyone? Let me know where you work so I can come by test your limit. Remember, any request I have you need to accommodate me"
"I don&#39;t see how a living baby is comparable to food, but ok. Nor do I see how one would be required to carry someone on their back if their job is a driver. These are odd comparisons."
"To answer your second question, I pick up from the local children&#39;s hospital from time to time. I don&#39;t think I have ever had a child. Usually it is staff."
"Last time I had a screaming baby from the airport, 45 mins and the women didn’t even have decency to tip.. if you get enough of those, it makes you a little jaded. No fault of yours though."
"We only live 12minutes from the hospital. So no risk of that. But I get it, some ppl have bad experiences with other ppls kids. 🤷🏾‍♀️ I was just momentarily shocked. "
Well now u know the reason. It&#39;s not ur fault. Driver just isn&#39;t willing to gamble his sanity/ car for a few bucks. 😂
Probably had an issue with baby puke or 💩 at some point and said &#39;nah never&#39;
I&#39;m curious about the teenager. A14 yr old teenager can look like the sweetest angel or your worst nightmare.
"If for example I’m by the beach and I accept a ride and the rider is either wet, full of sand, has an umbrella for the sand or even just a visual full on mess(heavily intoxicated) I just keep driving, screw all that and as some say here, it’s not worth the headache. If I pull up and you have 5-6 people and my car only fits 4 I don’t care how much you’ll “ tip “ me or say to take all pax. No one is getting in my car. You’re cancelling the ride and I’m getting payed… The driver probably drove off because he’s been on the bad end of the stick to many times and simply doesn’t want to deal with it. Drivers don’t usually look where exactly they are picking up the rider before accepting the trip, they look at how much they will make and how much they have to drive. It’s not like the app says “ pickup: children’s hospital “ … if it is already barely making sense financially to accept the ride for the driver imagine when they arrive and see said things. Too many previous bad experiences to allow themselves to be put in the same position again."
"I literally have signs on my car no eating, no drinking, no smoking, seatbelts on extc. And people still wipe their ass with the rules, no one gives a crap about your car so we do what we gotta do, especially when it’s not a rental. I check my car every time as pax get out of car and if they leave a cup, wrapper, whatever they may leave I call them out and hand it to them, and they’re all there like “oh” dumbfounded lol. My shit ain’t no trash can put that shit in your pocket and throw it away wherever you may be heading."
That’s so rude of people. As a passenger I had coffee with me once because I absentmindedly forgot to throw the cup out when I got off the train. I accidentally spilled it in this man’s car and I was so embarrassed. I made him wait when he dropped me off so I could run in my house and grab cleaning supplies and take care of it myself. Thankfully he had rubber mats on the floor and told me it was ok I didn’t have to fully clean it he would just hose them off later but I felt so awful and embarrassed. I don’t get how people can just leave shit in someone else’s cat.
I was drinking out a water bottle once and the driver hit a speed bump to quick and it knocked it out my hand. It was just a little water on the floor carpet but even I was embarrassed for that! lol and scared I took pics just cuz I’m always worried about a cleanup fee. I got one once because of my friend and since then I’m so cautious
Well we’re just good people and other people suck lol we were stressed over accidents and these people do it on purpose 🤦🏻‍♀️
"I have had women feed their babies and leave cookies/ candies/ milk all over the seat and not even apologize for it. Nevertheless, I see the kids, I will not cancel unless it’s a car seat issue but not without a polite conversation. Sorry it happened to you. Also sorry that some people on both sides of the app are asses."
"Last car seat trip I did, the car seat was full of food. All of that food ended up on my back seat and I had to stop what I was doing and go clean my car out. All for a trip that included no tip."
Drivers don’t get paid enough to deal with the bullshit. And I’m not even a driver lol.
Sounds like a rude jitney.
Not saying it’s right but judging from your emoji you might have been perceived as unlikely to tip base on stereotypes.
"I’m glad you’re home safe and sound, but I bet you didn’t tip."
Dang. That’s just foul. I’d feel horrible. And I’m sure you pushed through thinking she’d be generous. I’m
Yeah well I had a 45 minute drive where exactly one turn into their apartment complex the 7-year-old wakes up vomits all over the seats and carpet and she doesn&#39;t tip a dollar
Woman
So doing the job doesnt payenough? If Uber doesn&#39;t pay you enough why blame the riders?
"Complain when we don’t bring a carseat, complains when we do bring a carseat 😂 mothers can never catch a break"
Uber drivers complain either way because it sucks for them either way.
Do you tell drivers ahead of time you have a car seat or do you just spring it on them? If the latter that’s pretty fucked up
Y’all have excuses for literally everything. lol
They really do 🤣
Oh i wish i could up vote 20 times for this
this is literally the furthest extreme you can go. if this is the course we&#39;re taking here&#39;s this. a driver could have gotten a call from the hospital saying their wife/child is in ER and y&#39;all would say &quot;oh they just drove off? what an ass hole! they shouldn&#39;t even have this job!&quot;
That seems the most likely. Glad I don’t uber often. recent experiences have been 50/50.
Did you have a car seat?
"I drive on the side very occasionally. I don’t mind kids at all, I’m relatively patient. But if I can avoid a car seat, I’m going to. "
"Yeah, I can respect that. It’s the fact that he actually pulled up, took one look and then went “nope”. 😭"
Lesson learned. Next time message them ahead of time to make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again
Next time call a cab ! Are real driver not a contractor !
😂
"I have drivers do this to me almost every time I have my walker. They see me, they immediately speed off. Sometimes literally when I&#39;m about to reach for the door handle &amp; they notice it."
That’s awful but not the first time I’ve heard of that happening. I work with seniors &amp; they have similar experiences with mobility aids. Some ppl a just horrible to their fellow human beings. I’m so sorry.
"<a href=""https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/travel-options/accessible-services/access-transportation"">I’m pretty sure you’re eligible for Access. Once approved you’ll have reciprocal eligibility for ADA paratransit across the country</a>"
"Yeah, it sucks pretty enormously."
What do you mean trunk space you’re supposed to have available. Is this part of the agreement terms for the driver? I didn’t realize they were supposed to have an empty trunk
"Technically only Uber XL requires trunk space to be available I believe in their contract but for ADA it is a grey area they are supposed to be able to accommodate mobility devices if they are reasonable - and reasonable means they fit in a trunk. If you don&#39;t want to be in that grey area and you want to get tipped well by mobility device users (or people with luggage or groceries), don&#39;t keep junk on your trunk."
"Former driver here and although I never did that, I can understand why. Carseats take more time, not everyone is equipped to tolerate baby cries, and it can be a headache. The only times I refused rides were babies with no car seats. Not letting momma Brittany Spears that baby around town on my watch."
Only thing worse is a giant stroller you know is going to take work to get in the back.
"Definitely not great, but I think grocery shoppers are worse. I stopped accepting rides if I knew it was a grocery store. So many times its one small person with a dozen bags going to a walk up apartment."
A baby bucket seat takes as much time as an adult buckling up.
wait is my car seat like overly complicated or something because i took it to a certified car seat technician and it took her 7 minutes to install the one and 10 minutes for the infant carrier with the base😭she installs dozens a day so i imagine would be faster than the average person too.
"Only dealt with it a handful of times, but guessing nobody had this car seat."
As a driver. Sometimes we don’t see any information at all until we get there Soo yeah.. fun times.
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just because I&#39;m new to driving or not but I literally can&#39;t see my pickup destination until I&#39;m actually there. It just tells me &quot;ride available X minutes away. 13 minute trip&quot; 
There is a known uber driver scam of cancelling and claiming a no-show.
It&#39;s very unlikely a female driver would have left you there. Female drivers FTW 😎
And this is why we make 76¢ to a man&#39;s dollar.
And this is why we make 76¢ to a man&#39;s dollar.
i would imagine he has had bad experiences accepting rides with kids?
"I’m not a uber passenger driver, but any ride that involves more than just picking up one normal person would be a no for me 😂 who wants to deal with teenagers, babies, three riders, extra vehicle equipment like car seats"
What? Calling an uber for multiple people is very normal. 
Na I wouldn’t last even a day. That’s why I never signed up
Fair.
BUT- if I personally know you and knew you were a single mom- then I would drive out of my way to give you all the ride for free. So it’s nothing personal just business
"This goes both ways , I had an NFL football player see me pull up in my little Uber car and he walked back into the building. I messaged him a couple times that I was outside. But he just ignored me. So I cancelled the ride and went in my way. I guess he thought my car was too small or something. He could of just let Me know"
"Were you on the app as &quot;Uber XL&quot;? Because it costs more but I always go with that when I&#39;m with my college lineman friend . . . and sometimes what pulls up is a clown car anyway. In smaller cars my giant friend has to sit in front and adjust the seat to even get in their car. A car which was supposed to be XL, not some clown car. And then twice the driver gives us 1 star, I&#39;m assuming because they don&#39;t like driving someone who has to ride in the front, which is the icing on the cake, because in a reasonably XL vehicle he can get in back seat without a problem."
“Fuck them kids” -uber driver
Ya i have kid but I also used to drive. And not that everyone is the same but rides with kids are usually horrible. And drivers dont want to deal especially if its a low paying ride.
"For sure. So do rides with drunks. Rides with smelly people who smoke. Rides with dirty people. Etc etc. the list goes on man. Driving rideshare in general sucks, because the pay is low and having strangers in your vehicle can feel invasive."
I dont let them in my car either.
"I’m so sorry your driver was an asshole and so are the people defending him. Babies aren’t even that bad, most of the time they are asleep and much more quieter and well behaved than most drunks. It also takes like 10 seconds to run the seatbelt through the car seat and strap it in, it’s not even remotely difficult to do."
"Babies scream, but also sleep a lot. Worst are toddlers. They are little sh*ts even with the best of parents. After that kids are ok again if they are brought up properly, unfortunately a lot of people don&#39;t know how to parent and shouldn&#39;t have kids really."
Wow no wonder uber sucks 🤮 discrimination much?
Being a mother or a child is not a protected class
Ať least in Europe is. When you are with a child. Refusal of service is often discrimination.
It is actually as it is considered gender
"This isn&#39;t a legal /r. Discrimination can and does occur outside of what is legally protected, and this is almost certainly an example of it."
Literally the one thing that should be a protected class (I’m a dude btw)
I don’t want kids in my car
"Yes, but would you accept a ride from a pediatric hospital if you knew you didn’t want to give kids rides in your car? "
I mean a lot of the time hospital pick ups and drop off are nurses or some other staff
Could have been they were ok with ambulatory kids but some baby car seats can fuck up leather.
A car seat being on a leather seat for a very short period of time shouldn&#39;t be fucking anything up lol. It might leave an indent that takes an hour to disappear but that&#39;s about it
"I’m just offering possibilities. It could even be the last person with a car seat yanked it all over getting it in which can scratch them. I don’t know why the driver in this instance did t want to take it, but it’s their right to cancel whenever."
"Could be that he saw the newborn baby and was like &quot;nope, dont want to take the chance on hearing a screaming baby&quot;."
All I’m looking at is the pick up location
They don’t tell you where you’re going.
Just because it’s a children’s hospital doesn’t mean it’s guaranteed a child is a rider. Often the staff needs a ride from work.
Drivers dont all get the type of info. Seems to be area specific.
then get a different job
Don’t get a kid if you want a ride 
Then don&#39;t work as a rideshare driver 🤷🏿‍♂️
Me neither.
"pffft, I don’t even let my own kids in the car who the fuck thinks I want someone else’s…"
"The drivers are turning into babies, they probably don&#39;t want more than one in their car at a time."
I would&#39;ve done the same ✌️😂 not worth it
I hope you reported them to uber asking this question.
It&#39;s hard to figure out why he did that exactly.
Thats dumb to me. Why the fuck would u accept a pick up just to drive off bc there&#39;s kids. Its a children&#39;s hospital what do u expect?
"Im very tall and I guess I dont have a resting &quot;happy&quot; face. Trying to get a cab after work a few times, cabs would come near, turn off the &quot;on duty&quot; light, drive past, then id see it flick back on again."
"The driver may have thought you all were sick. If we get sick, we can&#39;t make money. I&#39;ve gotten the flu from someone&#39;s sick kid in my car. Occupational hazard, yes, but can we afford it? No :/"
"No it’s not that much more , I take a lot of trips to Mexico , I got a quote from uber and then I called a cab company it cost me $ 15.00 more I always have early flights set the service up the night before . Driver is always on time . I always tip at end of the ride . If diver loads my suitcase I give more. Not tipping until service is given"
He probably didn’t want to take the time to put the car seat in or possibly was even worried about the liability if the car seat wasn’t installed properly.
"Many drivers are assholes. They think the three minutes it takes to put in a carseat is going to cost them a lot. At most, we’re talking about $1.50 of potential lost income. "
"It’s not always about the car seat. While I don’t cancel any child as long as they are with an adult and have their car seat, I can tell you that in my experience, at least half the time, they are going to leave the car dirty. Feet on the Seats, dragging dirt/ mud/ slush/ snow whatever. Feet kicking the back on front seats. Candies/ cookies/ juice/ milk spillage "
"I never allowed my kids to eat,drink.. anything but water..in my own vehicle. I would treat others even better than my own."
Driver here.
"Oh, forgot to mention guaranteed no extra money for the added time and hassle. Next!"
"Lotta folks saying “moms don’t tip, not worth the hassle” and I’m starting to think maybe the folks saying that, just have shit customer service and don’t like kids."
"Just admit you are full of shit. Everyone on reddit is a perfect goody two shoes, does everything to be an angel. "
"Sis, I took him to task for you. Don’t waste your beautiful energy on that bigot. Enjoy your little one and your big/little one. 🤗 I got this! 💪🏾"
Newport 100s🤣🤣🤣
"I REALLY wish Uber would let drivers know how many riders to expect (and perhaps pay a little more per rider). That way, we can judge before we drive out to you and waste time."
I’ll tell you why…ride share companies don’t pay drivers enough while you sit and install a car seat then they gotta hear the baby whine and cry. When I see passengers with kids or babies I do the same thing…I just keep going and cancel. One thing for sure tho if I see any riddle to a hospital I don’t accept it. We don’t get paid enough to assist people and all the extra stuff. Uber and Lyft want drivers to be volunteers too…yeah no thank you
More than likely it was the 14 year old more than the car seat. Young teens and kids are a nightmare and usually always require a stop and clean after the ride. 
"Disagree. Teens, especially accompanied by adults, aren’t messy. That’s more of a toddler thing. "
What do you mean by garunterd?
I wish as a server I could just walk up to a table be like nahhhh and walk away. 🙈🤣😩
[deleted]
Uber drivers: &quot;how hard is it to be outside waiting when your driver arrives?? You can see when we are arriving. What&#39;s wrong with people?!&quot;
And throwing misogyny at her now too!
when your driver is approaching you have to walk OUTSIDE to get in the car.
“YoUrE tHe OnE sTaNdInG oUtSiDe”. Are you always a pathetic troll or just sometimes?
"Mind you, if utilizing uber service is worthy of ridicule then how do they feel about the 50+ yr old man that has to drive uber???"
Or the almost 70yr old woman driver?
You’re not wrong lol 
Tbf probably saw the Uber was close and went outside to wave them down
I&#39;m not a driver but no feeaking kid ever gonna get on my car. Not even family lmao
But you’re not a driver!!! lol it makes sense for people who work any other job that doesn’t involve accepting money from random people for rides
"If Uber wants drivers who take any riders, they can get drivers that are paid hourly to take all rides. But they don’t bc Uber prefers to use contractors who can show up and leave just like this the way an hourly employee would not be allowed to. "
True haha. I&#39;m just saying that I can sympathize with the driver dude in this case. We&#39;re all human after all
Too bad you weren&#39;t left behind as a child. Children are not the problem. Adults who don&#39;t bother teaching the kids how to behave are. No children drive drunk. They don&#39;t do drugs nor trash public restrooms. That&#39;s adults. I would rather have a roomful of children than even one hateful adult.
"I have a folding walker. I always communicate that when ordering a ride. . Driver can choose to accept the ride or not, based on that information."
welcome to the pain of being a black man in america.
More dicklike behavior from a driver.
[deleted]
"Why don&#39;t you just call a cab company? Half of Uber drivers, drive around like freaking lunatics as it is. It never used to be like this, but lately its been absolute shit luck for me..."
"That’s very ignorant of that driver , it’s most important to complete any accepted rides, especially with a mom and her baby and other child , u never know maybe she is single and likes the driver LoL I’m just saying "
"That happened to me once, I forgot to report him smh"
I’m sure the driver saw the seat and didn’t want to deal with it. Hooking up to different cars can be difficult or take a moment to find the hooks. And they may not want to deal with sticky substances on base or deal with a kid throwing up in their car. It slows things down and they may not have had a good experience with it at all. Unfortunately it’s their cars their rules. I refuse old farts with wheel chairs because it slows me down and wheelchairs dont fit well in my trunk. Car seats I usually hook up myself as my hooks are deep and not the easiest to find. And I wouldn’t want my wife to be turned away just because of our infant.
"Yupp drivers just want quick money, why i never feel bad for not tipping"
Loser driver doing loser job
Maybe you picked saver its for only one person (its Uber share renamed)
So… I always see an option “car seat” when choosing which ride. I assumed this is a car with a seat already installed. Is it not?
"Hate to say it but it’s the way parents act with their kids. I’d cancel too. There’s actually another element, I don’t do hospital pickups. I do this very part time and I’m not catching some weird thing when I never go to the hospital. That on top of the mess left by a parent who doesn’t know how to control their kids on my leather seats, not worth it. I’m sure you’re a fine parent, you can thank the crappy ones for this stereotype."
Is it possible they didn&#39;t have a car seat? Hmm I&#39;m not familiar if that&#39;s an option to select. I&#39;m not a parent myself nor am I commercial/Uber/Lyft driver but I&#39;d feel SO nervous having someone else&#39;s NEWBORN in my car! 😭 And I&#39;m a good driver with a good driving record!
"A mother has a lot on her hands I do agree. But the main concern is the car seat, they&#39;ve been dragging this around for a while. What they “all” do is try and put in the car with the baby sitting in it. This makes it very heavy to try and hold out and set it in the back seat. This always abruptly slapped down and then slid a cross the back seat, all without giving two shits about your brand-new leather upholstery. And there will also be commenters who don&#39;t give a rats ass either. This is why I drive away when I See a mom with a car seat."
"Damn. It sucks but you’re not wrong about the damage and lack of care to ruin upholstery but there’s a better way to combat it — get the quilted animal car seat covers only— makes a massive difference. Source: me, used to drive when it was a more lucrative thing to do."
Yes you have a good solution I do have a small quilted blanket I can use. I&#39;ll use your tip- 👍
"Happy to help and hope you have good riders during your next shift. Providing a service like this isn’t easy and people can be really crap, I get it 🫶🏽"
Test
"I had driver do that to me and my friends at a hotel, I was literally about to get in but then he was like &quot;no airport&quot; and I said no and then he said get out and immediately drove off. Then I saw him pull back up 2 minutes to pick up people who was going to the airport"
I applaud you for having a car seat! I’ve left people because they didn’t know they needed one..
I always put in the notes if I have a car seat and/or stroller with me.
Did you stste it was 3 people in the reservation?
"Like, I&#39;ve never cancelled for it myself. But car seats are always something and the of you means someone is probably going to sit up front bc car seats are a bit wider than a 3rd person. So it was two things that he probably just didn&#39;t feel like dealing with. Plus people always try not buckling on the baby and/or car seat and now you gotta either let it go or risk a snippy argument about it. I won&#39;t even accept pick ups at the local public health center because of this. People trying to hold infants in their lap like c&#39;mon"
GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW
iykyk
"Baby puke, formula stains, I understand it. Alot of drivers don&#39;t have seat covers or rubber floor mats (which they should) I use them and can cleanup a spill in 20 seconds, but those drivers with cloth/fabric seats will have to see a detailer, or try to get some dishwashing liquid to scrub the stain out, if it ever fully comes out."
"It&#39;s the baby. If if the carseat isn&#39;t installed correctly and something happens, he knows he&#39;s at a huge liability. I&#39;d probably do the same."
"OP I’m sorry you had to experience this, all the comments defending the driver and making excuses are actually wild to me. I’m glad you’re home safely with your babies"
There are grave injustices virtually every moment of every day. On to the next one.
It could’ve been a doctor! Seriously though he may be multi-apping and the other app finally selected him and it paid more so he took it. Baby not stuck in sun. Yall can always go back in A/C bldg.
As a parent i will say that sometimes drivers just don&#39;t want to deal with potentially hearing a baby cry. 
I had my eye and part of my face bandaged after a procedure. Driver saw me and immediately canceled and drove away while I was walking to his car. Guess I know what to wear on Halloween.
"Happened to me... Yeah sadly there are people like that. Would be very unlikely to happen e.g. in Argentina or Spain (provided it&#39;s not a lack of child seat issue, which in your case it wasn&#39;t). Don&#39;t let this terrible attitude get to you and ruin your day! Think about this: these people are less likely to want to have kids, which means there&#39;s higher chance their DNA won&#39;t pass along, and maybe in a couple generations we will get a society where treating kids as some sort of inconvenience will become less normal."
Uber really needs to have an option to specify passengers.
Did you have a car seat?
Can you read?
Did you have a car seat?
She literally says in her post “standing outside holding a car seat”
"This has happened to me alot with a baby. Lots of drivers don&#39;t want babies I guess. When my son was a baby we didn&#39;t have a car and I&#39;d say that happened at least 12 times, where they&#39;d come drive by me stare and then drive away and cancel the ride."
"I once had an uber pull up to my house while I was still inside. Before they ever saw me they cancelled the ride and left. The only thing I could come up with is they saw the progressive sign in my yard (along the lines of “every human is legal, everyone deserves marriage” etc) and cancelled because of that lol"
Your name wouldn&#39;t happen to be Dank Demoss? That might explain a few things.
Did you have a car seat ?
"The fact that you were holding the car seat makes this unacceptable. If you did not have a proper car seat for the child by law, the driver should refuse you entry to his vehicle. As he is not a a taxi or limo service. He would legally be responsible for making sure all passengers were probably restrained in the vehicle. The fact that you had a car seat he should’ve had no worries about accepting the child."
My favorite part of this post is &quot;outside in the sun!&quot;
Drivers complain about low fares then act like this lmao
LMAO HAHA
"So one thing that I find, is that bigger cities slow down and become less profitable during the summer. Different cities are different so I&#39;m not speaking about all of them. Universities and other schools are out of session. A lot of businesses don&#39;t hold as many meetings or functions during the summer, because more people take time off. Not to say no one vacations in Denver in the summer, but most people are going to beaches or things like that. I would think a place like Denver would be more profitable in the winter time and early spring during ski season."
"Denver is not a ski town. The mountains look close when you&#39;re in Denver, but the nearest ski resort to Denver is at least a 60 mile drive. Tourism in Denver is highest in the summer because the kids are out of school, same as it is everywhere else."
"It&#39;s not about tourism, per se. It&#39;s about population increase. I&#39;m on the north east coast so forgive my bias, but Cape Cod increases in busyness by multiples during the summer, there are restaurants and hotels that are only open during those months. Whereas Boston loses a significant percentage of college students, and lower level schools, and fewer people are coming in for business. Plenty of people from the local suburbs who would normally go out for dinner in Boston, are down the Cape, or on vacation elsewhere. Are there people coming to visit Boston? Of course. But the question is does the number of people coming in outdo the number of people leaving?"
"But Boston is a college town where Denver really isn&#39;t. Colorado also doesn&#39;t have like a designated vacation place, the way Cape Cod is for Boston."
"Yeh Boston has more universities sure, but it&#39;s not like Denver has none, quick Google search said there are at least 35 colleges, UC Denver itself has 25k, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s one of the more populated, but it isn&#39;t inconceivable to think there&#39;s 100k if not more college students, a good percentage of which leave."
"Denver is a popular tourist destination in the spring/summer/fall just because it is the only big city I the region. It&#39;s &quot;the city&quot; for a vast region. People think of it as a ski town and it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s the high plains."
"Rates are too low because too many people sign up for this gig without any instruction on how to properly do it. Predatory company Uber uses that sample material to base pricing on. Too many of the rides that aren&#39;t supposed to be accepted at $3 are being accepted by people who should not be driving on the platform, and are probably part-timers. Without rate cards, this is how drivers get abused. And passengers are able to be manipulated into paying higher fares versus somebody else in the same location driving to the same drop-off point."
The whole point of Uber is that I won&#39;t have to talk to the driver.
"If all drivers knew how to follow a map and GPS instructions, I&#39;d agree. But I&#39;ve had several who have missed turns, ignore the GPS and make the route longer than it needs to be. And it&#39;s understandable, if you&#39;re not familiar with an area that has &quot;weird&quot; turns or intersections you can get confused. But if I LIVE in this area and take this ride DAILY and politely tell you &quot;Yes, you can turn here&quot; [Like the GPS tells you to] but you ignore me and make a right to go down a long ass road only to have to double back... you&#39;re the problem."
I frankly don&#39;t care if the trip takes a bit longer. 
As a driver I can tell you the passengers who want it quiet are few and far in between.
As an immigrant I totally agree with you. Personally been in spots where elderly people needed folks to understand English fluently and most of them have a sigh of relief knowing I do cause when I pick up a pax that can’t communicate I put myself in shoes of the Customer having drivers that can’t speak English fluently.
Exactly 💯💯💯 you get it!!!
"Lol I drive in an area with a large Somali population and some snarky riders got mad that I don&#39;t provide snacks or water. They asked what sets me apart from the other drivers in this town and I said &quot;well, English is my first language&quot;."
I&#39;m mean. There is an option for language when giving a one star. I hammer that one.
I’m going to have to look into that 1
"Most of the decent drivers here in the United States left (UBER) last year when the rates dropped so badly, it wasn’t worth driving anymore. Now you have a lot of these people that are on visas or illegally renting accounts to drive that are OK with accepting low fares, as they’re limited to what money they can make… and (UBER) is very aware of this… they busted a fraud ring last year of people that were renting out accounts so illegal immigrants could drive…. And it’s across all platforms like DoorDash, Walmart plus, Instacart, Lyft, ect."
Just a Headsup those with H1B visas can’t do uber or any of those Gigs which can lead to them having their visas revoked and many new people who arrived in the U.S they aren’t allowed to do Uber/Lyft until one year of residency here.
Put up a wanted ad
"A lot of the good drivers quiting. Uber has slashed income so much that most minimum wage jobs pay the same at this point if you don&#39;t have a good market and tipping is at an all time low. So you going to be left with shit drivers, or people that can&#39;t even go to a minimum wage job for some reason like speaking no English. Only going to get worse. It&#39;s likely going to become UberX is going to be a hell ride and you going to have to order Uber comfort/Black to get someone that speaks English."
Exactly 💯💯💯!!!
All airline pilots must speak English for communication with Air traffic controllers. Globally
Thank God taxis also have a class about the city and yearly hospitality class about new things to see and do in Nashville.
That&#39;s awesome and should happen everywhere 💵🧔🏾💵
"I’ve not had any problems at all with English-challenged drivers, some of whom are native English speakers."
‘English challenged’? Seriously? LOLOL Is that the new woke term for uneducated?
I think it was worded that way specifically as part of the joke 🙄
There are a profligate number of English challenged posters on this forum.
If they can request a woman they should be able to request an English speaker
Exactly 💯💯💯
"At the very least, passengers should know what language the driver speaks so they can use a translation app."
I don&#39;t want to use a translation app. I want a LOCAL ENGLISH SPEAKING DRIVER I can talk to and ask questions about the region I am visiting.
The non English speaker here should be using translator not the English speaker. He’s not the one in a foreign land. 🤦‍♀️
This shit is funny. We got a unhinged racist Trump Supporter going off about a contract worker not speaking English.
Totally agree 👍🏻
"This is one of the few jobs migrants can do to support themselves and their families. If you don’t like it, walk."
No 🤷🏾🚖 knowing something about the region you drive in is part of the job. Drivers are supposed to be knowledgeable local ambassadors. 
Absolutely!!!!
"No, they are supposed to safely follow the blue line on the app. Thats it."
"Not how it works chief. If my ride is somehow hindered because you can’t speak the language, it’s gonna be a 1-star and I’m mashing the language option with the force of a thousand suns. I don’t go to foreign countries expecting people to understand my English, so why should someone WORKING here be unable to speak the language? FOH. I don’t give a shit if you’re the pope, if you’re doing this job, you better be able to communicate."
You are entitled to call a car service or hire your own personal driver. 
Uber is a car service. People should be able to request local drivers who speak English.
"I would think if in France that my driver speaks French. In the U.S. English is the predominant language. Even taxi drivers now have to pass an English class to drive in Nashville. Sadly some use their phones and still can’t speak a lick of English only knowing, “40 dolla! 40 dolla!”"
France has an official language under federal law. The United States does not.
They also are taught English in schools like most other developed countries. We are actually the dumb shit who can barley speak one language
lol I work in Nashville and in the hotel industry and would like to you to post a source for please. I have taxis who don’t speak English fully all the time. I also have this where it doesn’t say a word about what you said. So correct me if I’m wrong with your source. 
This screams Trump voter
I am just speaking facts and communicating what passengers are saying to me 💵🧔🏾💵🤷🏾💵
lol ooo you are a driver who is bitter that a immigrant took your job. 
I’m a uber driver My passengers usually don’t get racist with me 😂. I would assume you pick who you talk to about your raciest tendencies too😭.
No. They actually shouldn&#39;t.
Learn something about the region you drive in!!!! Learn to speak English!!! 
You know there are apps on your phone that will translate simple phrases into almost any language?
Passengers should be allowed to request a local driver who knows something about the region they drive in.
"That&#39;s a guided tour. If thats what you want, its way more expensive. "
People pay me more 💵🤷🏾💵🧔🏾💵
"I agree if you can communicate with the driver and you want a good place to eat, get some booze, or find someone local who knows who sells weed, how are you going to ask. "
I don’t care and never had issues with them. They get me to my destination lol.
🤡🤡
I’m a clown because I could give two fucks if someone can’t really speak English? Lmao I don’t want to talk during my ride anyways so that’s better for me and they do their job and get me to my destination lol but I’m a clown? Ok 😂 
"No you are not a clown, but you don&#39;t sound like a person who cares about the people driving you. "
The MAGA cult passed a law requiring all truck drivers know how to read and write and speak English. Maybe you should write your racist Maga representative and ask for the same in Uber. I am sure he would love to hear from you with yet another racist way they can make America white again.
Im down for that. 
"Not a racist 🤷🏾 I just want to request a driver who knows something about the place they are driving. I want a driver I can ask a question like, where can I get a bottle of wine on the way to my hotel?"
"Ok dude i speak english, grew up in the city i drive in, and i couldnt even answer that question. "
Unfortunately too many drivers don&#39;t recognize that people visiting a region are looking at the drivers as representatives of that region. Whether we like it or not we are ambassadors and if we don&#39;t take pride in the place where we are that gives a bad impression of the region and it&#39;s people.
Just a question if you have a map to fallow where to pickup and drop off the customer why speak English is necessary ?
Because you are in America. End of.
Restaurant recommendations/ emergency stops etc/ tourist locations.
That’s not why Uber exists.
I drive in a tourist-heavy area. People appreciate $$$ my assistance.
you are so unbelievably lazy
?
The app tells you where to go.
"If you’re not looking to reinvent the business model, why on earth do you think you’ll have any pull and convince people to stop using Uber/Lyft? Not looking to hate, serious question."
"We&#39;re not trying to reinvent the business models of others . Our influence comes from value: instead of selling a ride, we sell intelligence and predictability. Users will turn to our app not for a different price, but for an experience that gives them control and transparency they can&#39;t find anywhere else, making the current model obsolete"
"But if you’re not reinventing the business model, you’re also not doing enough to make the existing one obsolete. The app idea is good generally, but it’ll be an impossible task to displace the giants."
"The argument that our failure to reinvent the business model dooms us to failure is a misunderstanding of our approach. Our model is, in fact, a reinvention, because it&#39;s based on selling intelligence, not logistics."
"Attracting users is one thing, what’s your plan to attract a national driver base, large enough so that it does truly offer convenience to the customer?"
"Our plan is not to compete with the giants on a national scale with the number of drivers, which is too costly a strategy. Instead, we are focusing on high-density areas to ensure high-quality service from the outset."
"That makes sense. Get the marketing right, ensure the AI is doing enough to genuinely save the drivers money and time, and offer competitive splits and I see no reason why you shouldn’t succeed."
Thank you for taking the time to chat and for your questions.
"The key difference here isn&#39;t a change in the business model, but a radically new user experience"
The question is how. I don’t like the uber app but that has nothing to do with the layout and everything to do with driver attitudes and car quality.
Unclear what you are trying to do My user experience would only be improved when uber stops playing tricks. When comfort was rolled out where I am it was promised that drivers needed to be above 4.92. And I heard drivers saying they are aiming for 4.92 to do comfort. There were also strictly no hatchbacks on comfort according to my country’s uber website. 
"The problem isn&#39;t the interface, but Uber&#39;s system that encourages the frustrating behaviors you describe."
Unless it aims to change driver behaviour by giving them the kind of training in customer service drivers got when uber first started I don’t see anything changing.
"The human element is essential. Rather than relying on costly, one-time training, our app uses Al as a real-time &quot;customer service coach.&quot;"
Credits expire anyway
Yes but I want to use the credits on my personal Ubers and not my work ones. I spend probably $600/week on Ubers just for work. I&#39;ve been buying the gift cards at Costco for 80% of value and want to use them for the work Ubers and expense the full value.
Nothing?
